Exercise 2.10
Question:
What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?

std::string global_str;
int global_int;
int main(){
  
  int local_int;
  std::string local_str;
  
  return 0;
}

Solution:
global_int:
Direct Answer: Value is 0
Explanation: This is because global_int is in the global scope (thus; outside all functions).

global_str:
Direct Answer: Value is "" (thus; the empty string)
Explanation: std::string value is a user defined type and what happens to it when an object of it is initialized
without any value is defined by the type as the "" or empty string. Therefore it's scope does not really affect it's value.

local_int:
Direct Answer: Undefined(a value that is not known; and can be anything)
Explanation: Because this int object is defined at local scope.

local_str:
Direct Answer: Value is "" (thus; the empty string)
Explanation: std::string value is a user defined type and what happens to it when an object of it is initialized
without any value is defined by the type as the "" or empty string. Therefore it's scope does not really affect it's value.
